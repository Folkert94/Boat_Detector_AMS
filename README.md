# Boat Detector Amsterdam

Hobby project where I detect boats on the canals outside of my house. The end product is a report with an overview on how many boats passed by.

### Data

I set up an old iPhone as a webcam and monitored this stream. In the initial phase I captured a picture every 10 seconds, to not take too many space in my HDD, and then manually filtered all the images that had any boats in it. Later I automatically took pictures every second when there were moving objects in the picture and determine how many boats passed by over a certain time period.

### Further 

- Determine what kind of boat is passing by (longboat, cargo, canoe, sup?).
