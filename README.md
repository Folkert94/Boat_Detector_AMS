# Boat_Detector_AMS

Hobby project where I detect boats on the canals outside of my house. The end product is a report with an overview on how many boats and what type was detected.

### Data

I set up an old iPhone as a webcam and monitored this stream. In the initial phase I captured a picture every 10 seconds, to not take too many space in my hard-drive, and then manually filtered all the images that had any boats in it. Later I automatically took pictures every second when there were moving objects in the picture. These were then used to filter types of boats (canoes, cargo ships, longboats).
